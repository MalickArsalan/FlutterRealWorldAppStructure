# Mastering Repository Pattern

Almost every app, from the simplest to the most complex, contains these two elements in its architecture:

- **State managers**: Blocs, Cubits, Providers, ViewModels and so on.
- **Data sources**: Classes that interact directly with the database or network client to fetch responses and return them as parsed models.

Let say, connecting a state manager directly to a data source works great --- as long as there's only one data source in that relationship. Things get messy when there's more than one, such as when apps need to cache data.

Note: **Caching** means backing up your API results in a local database.

The **repository pattern** consists of creating a class, the repository, that sits in the middle of your state managers and data sources and takes all the coordination effort away from your state managers. In other words, your state managers won't have to care where the data comes from anymore.

## Introducing Class Dependencies

A **class dependency** is any class that another class depends upon to do its work. For example, if `QuoteRepository` relies on `FavQsApi` to fetch its data, that makes `FavQsApi` a class dependency of `QuoteRepository`. Simple, right?

Now, there are two ways a class can get an instance of one of its class dependencies:

1. **Instantiating it by itself**: You can do this inside the constructor, in the property's declaration, just before using it in a function or anywhere else you want. An extremely minimal example would be:

```kotlin
class QuoteRepository 
{ 
    final FavQsApi _favQsApi = FavQsApi(); 
    // Omitted code. 
}
```

The first one has the benefit that you don't expose your inner dependencies to users of your class, which makes your classes more self-contained.

2. **Requiring an instance to be passed in its constructor**: For example:

```kotlin
class QuoteRepository { 
    const QuoteRepository( this.favQsApi, ); 
    final FavQsApi favQsApi; 
    // Omitted code. 
}
```

Both approaches have pros and cons.

### Fetching Policies

- **cacheAndNetwork**: Emit cached quotes first, if any, followed by quotes from the server, if the HTTP call succeeds. Useful for when the user first opens the app.
- **networkOnly**: Don't use the cache in any situation. If the server request fails, let the user know. Useful for when the user consciously refreshes the list.
- **networkPreferably**: Prefer using the server. If the request fails, try using the cache. If there isn't anything in the cache, then let the user know an error occurred. Useful for when the user requests a subsequent page.
- **cachePreferably**: Prefer using the cache. If there isn't anything in the cache, try using the server. Useful for when the user clears a tag or the search box.
