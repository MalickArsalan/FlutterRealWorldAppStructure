# Mastering Repository Pattern

Almost every app, from the simplest to the most complex, contains these two elements in its architecture:

- **State managers**: Blocs, Cubits, Providers, ViewModels and so on.
- **Data sources**: Classes that interact directly with the database or network client to fetch responses and return them as parsed models.

Let say, connecting a state manager directly to a data source works great --- as long as there's only one data source in that relationship. Things get messy when there's more than one, such as when apps need to cache data.

Note: **Caching** means backing up your API results in a local database.

The **repository pattern** consists of creating a class, the repository, that sits in the middle of your state managers and data sources and takes all the coordination effort away from your state managers. In other words, your state managers won't have to care where the data comes from anymore.

## Introducing Class Dependencies

A **class dependency** is any class that another class depends upon to do its work. For example, if `QuoteRepository` relies on `FavQsApi` to fetch its data, that makes `FavQsApi` a class dependency of `QuoteRepository`. Simple, right?

Now, there are two ways a class can get an instance of one of its class dependencies:

1. **Instantiating it by itself**: You can do this inside the constructor, in the property's declaration, just before using it in a function or anywhere else you want. An extremely minimal example would be:

    ```kotlin
    class QuoteRepository 
    { 
        final FavQsApi _favQsApi = FavQsApi(); 
        // Omitted code. 
    }
    ```

    The first one has the benefit that you don't expose your inner dependencies to users of your class, which makes your classes more self-contained.

2. **Requiring an instance to be passed in its constructor**: For example:

    ```kotlin
    class QuoteRepository { 
        const QuoteRepository( this.favQsApi, ); 
        final FavQsApi favQsApi; 
        // Omitted code. 
    }
    ```

    Both approaches have pros and cons.

### Fetching Policies

- **cacheAndNetwork**: Emit cached quotes first, if any, followed by quotes from the server, if the HTTP call succeeds. Useful for when the user first opens the app.
- **networkOnly**: Don't use the cache in any situation. If the server request fails, let the user know. Useful for when the user consciously refreshes the list.
- **networkPreferably**: Prefer using the server. If the request fails, try using the cache. If there isn't anything in the cache, then let the user know an error occurred. Useful for when the user requests a subsequent page.
- **cachePreferably**: Prefer using the cache. If there isn't anything in the cache, try using the server. Useful for when the user clears a tag or the search box.

### Key Points

- Repositories become indispensable when you have more than one data source involved in the same operation. The most common situation where that happens is when you cache API results.
- **Caching** improves the user experience by allowing your app to respond faster and without an internet connection. It also saves data consumption by avoiding unnecessary round-trips to the server.
- A **repository** is an orchestrator of **data sources**. It abstracts the actual source of the data away from your state managers.
- When a **class dependency** is defined in the same package you’re working on, you should instantiate it inside the dependent class. Alternatively, if a class dependency comes from another internal package, you should require it to be passed in the constructor.
- Structuring a package with an **src** folder and a **barrel file** allows you to cherry-pick the files you want to export and hide your package’s internal structure.
- **Pagination** minimizes the risk of fetching data unnecessarily.
- **Streams** are just **Futures** that can emit multiple results.
- A **fetch policy** is the strategy you use to fetch some piece of data. Sometimes having a single policy is not good enough, so you should allow the caller of the function to decide the most appropriate policy for each moment.
- Each source of data in your app needs its own model classes. Ultimately, **mapper functions** will convert these source-specific models into neutral/domain models to avoid leaking implementation details throughout your codebase.
